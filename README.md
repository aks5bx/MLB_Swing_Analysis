# MLB Swing Analysis

## Introduction

The goal of this analysis is to probabilistically predict whether or not a player will swing at a ball that comes their way. This analysis ultimately utilizes a Random Forest Algorithm in order to achieve this goal. Using 1500 estimators, this algorithm concludes with a 79.96% Accuracy Score and a 76.72% F1 Score. The model is expected to scale well and can handle both additional data records and additional features. The analysis that follows details the process and decisions made in order to produce the aforementioned model.

Note: this analysis is intended for an audience with some, but perhaps not a deep understanding of Statistics and Baseball. However, the analysis should generally be understandable to those without this background.
